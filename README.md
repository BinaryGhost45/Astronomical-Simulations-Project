# Astronomical Simulations Project 🌌

Welcome to my **Astronomical Simulations Project**! This repository is dedicated to creating interactive 3D simulations of celestial objects and phenomena using **VPython** and physics-based models. The goal is to provide educational, visual, and dynamic representations of the universe.

---

## Current Status
This repo is a **work in progress**. The simulations in this repository are designed to model real-world astronomical phenomena, including:

The current simulations are scalable and can be extended to model more complex systems.

---

## Planned Simulations
This is a **long-term project**. I plan to add the following advanced simulations in the near future:

- **Black Holes** 🕳️ — gravitational fields, event horizon, and accretion disks
- **Pulsars** ⭐ — rotating neutron stars and their magnetic fields
- **Supernovae & Novae** 💥 — stellar explosions with particle effects
- **Star Birth & Star Death** 🌟 — formation of stars and their life cycle
- **Neutrino Emission** 🧬 — visualization of particle emission from cosmic events
- **Galaxy Formation & Dynamics** 🌌 — multi-body gravitational systems

These simulations will include **interactive controls**, **date/time sliders**, **visual trails**, and realistic **3D orbital physics**.

---

## Features (Planned)
- Realistic 3D orbits with **tilt and inclination**
- Adjustable **time-step and speed sliders** to view long-term evolution
- Trails to visualize orbital paths
- Dynamic display of **simulation date and time**
- Fully scalable to include multiple celestial objects
- Emphasis on **educational clarity** and visualization of physics principles

---

## Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **VPython** for 3D visualization
- **NumPy** for calculations and orbital mechanics

---

## Contributions
This is primarily a **personal project**, but suggestions, improvements, and contributions are welcome. If you have ideas for new simulations or optimizations, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

---

## Notes
- This repository will continue to grow as new simulations are added.
- The focus is on **physics-based modeling**, not game-like mechanics.
- Separate folders may be created for prototypes and smaller experimental simulations.

Stay tuned for upcoming simulations! 🚀  
Your support, suggestions, and feedback are highly appreciated.
