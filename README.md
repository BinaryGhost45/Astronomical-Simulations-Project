# Astronomical-Simulations-Project
welcome to my **Astronomical Simulations Project**! This repository is dedicated to creating interactive 3D simulations of celestial objects and phenomena using **VPython** and physics-based models. The goal is to provide educational, visual, and dynamic representations of the universe.
