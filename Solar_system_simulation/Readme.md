# Solar System Simulations ðŸŒŒ

This folder is dedicated to **simulations of the Solar System**.  
Here, you will find interactive 3D models of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies using **VPython**.  

---

## Purpose
The goal is to visualize the motions of celestial objects in a realistic and educational way.  
Simulations will include:
- Planetary orbits around the Sun  
- Moon revolutions around planets  
- Orbital tilts and inclinations  
- Adjustable time and speed for long-term observation  

---

## Future Simulations
This folder will expand to include more advanced Solar System models, such as:
- Multi-planet systems with realistic physics  
- Asteroid belts and minor planets  
- Interactive controls and visualization enhancements  

---

## Features
- 3D visualization with trails for each body  
- Tilted orbital planes for realistic motion  
- Adjustable simulation speed and time display  
- Modular code structure for easy extension
